# Graph Kata Scala

A kata to explore the usage of graphs in Scala, using
the [Scala-graph](https://scala-graph.org/) library.

## Instructions

Start with the FamilyTreeSpec and follow the instructions from there.

There is one failing test to start fixing,
after that each next case is marked with an `ignore` statement.
This allows you to enable the test case when you get to it.
